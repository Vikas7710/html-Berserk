                <h2>The Materpiece landed by a great mangaka.</h2>
                <p> I'm really in awe of late Kentaro Miura's work on <strong>"Berserk"</strong> which consumed
                    more than three decades of his life (1989-). The manga is nothing short of "genius" as
                    the way kentaro illustrated it is a masterclass itself, The world-building, The
                    character-development,
                    and most importantly "The Art work", Berserk is widely known for it's art work and is
                    said to have some of the most gruesome and diabolical pages to be ever drawn by a mangaka. </p>

                    penned chapter 364 as the last of his legacy. The work of his life is now being carried
                    out by his childhood bestfriend "Koji Mori" as he's trying answer all the questions fans
                    have been waiting to be answered for more than decades now.
                    The manga is shortly divided into five arcs, also listed in the order of their release - </p>

                <h2>Stroy walk-through.</h2>
                <p>Being set in the medieval europe, The story is a complete package and carries
                    a pinch of all "Dark-fantasy", "High-fantasy", "Swords and Sorcery". The story primarily
                    focuses on a lone-swordsman "Guts" and secondarily on the characters that revolve around him.
                    The events of the black swordsmen arc are the one's which occured after the golden age arc in
                    chronological order. </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p> <strong>The black swordsmen arc</strong> follows the heroic and adventures tale's of our main
                    character Guts
                    who's set's out on a journey to find 'Griffith' a very main character of our story also
                    someone who used to be Guts's friend in the distant past, in order to annihilate and cease his
                    existence to soak up his revenge upon him.
                    The scars and brusies that Griffith gave him are some what indelible. </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p> <strong>The Golden age arc</strong> is where all this begins from, From Guts being born from the
                    womb
                    of a dead women on a battlefield to him joining the band of the hawk's as a mercenery.
                    Guts, Griffith and Casca were in the same "Band of the hawk" led by the illusionary, beautifull
                    and mesmerizing Griffith himself, untill the night of havoc tained the tapestry of Gut's life
                    turning it completey upside down. <strong>The infamous "Eclipse",</strong> which takes place only
                    once in every 216 years. Griffith in hunger for power and dream to have his own kingdom sacrificed
                    his own band while using Guts and Casca as the sacrifical pawns inorder to become one of the five
                    god-hand members. Not enough of him to even make Guts watch his love intrest Casca getting raped.
                    Guts went berserk and amputated his arm off but barely managed to even lay a blow on the newly
                    incarnated God-hand member the mighty "Femto". Luckily someone was keeping an eye on Guts looking
                    out for him the annonymous "skull knight" who ultimately saved his and Casca's life by pulling
                    them out of the eclipse. </p>

                <p> <strong>The Conviction Arc</strong>picks the story up right where the golden age
                    arc ended, Guts our fearsome hero sets out on yet another journey but this time to
                    find casca as she went doodling because of her mental retardness. Casca finds herself
                    trapped and accussed for being a witch by an holy see apostle "Mozgus" and was sentenced to
                    be burned alive just when Guts interviene's and save's her, this is also when they meet
                    after two years. During the events of the "birth ceremony arc" Femto is reborn as Griffith. </p>
